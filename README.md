# ARandomBank

- npm install && node server.js

# Done:
  - Create a company
  - Create a user
  - Create a wallet for a company
  - Create a card associated to a wallet for a user
  - List company's users' cards
  - List user's cards
  - Deposit/credit funds from a wallet towards a card
  
# Missing, due to lack of time:
  - Card (un)blocking
  - Transfers between wallets (hence fees and so on)
  - Input sanitizing (check what is sent to our server)
  - Documentation (I used Insomnia to mock my endpoints and failed to translate the Insonmia's export to a Swagger format. You can find the Insomnia export above, for what it worth)
  - and so on (linter, CI/CD, TU/TI/E2E)..
